# Defining-words-from-audio-files

You are given a set of audio files in WAV format. Each audio file is one second long where exactly one of 10 English words is pronounced. Set of words: ['cat', 'dog', 'five', 'four', 'house', 'one', 'six', 'step', 'three', 'two'].

The task is to write a program that will automatically determine which word is pronounced in the audio file.
